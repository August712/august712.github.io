Description:

    So I recently got back into the video game scene after Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild came out earlier this year, and in
    the game, you can tap an amiibo figure to the left joy-con to get some extra items/buffs. I thought this was really cool, but
    I really hated carrying a big, oddly shaped figurine in my pocket everywhere I went. So, I decided to make it into a card, 
    that could fit in your wallet.
    
    I started research, and found that amiibos use NTAG215's and had two partitions, one Read-only and one Read/Write. After doing
    a bit more of research and coding, I found out a way to write game data to NFC tags using an android phone. This writeup
    documents the fruit of my 3 weeks of labor.


Results:

    NFC tags are able to load data into games


Tools Used:

    - A couple NTAG215s (Tagstand)
    - Locked-Secret key file (Found these myself)
    - Unfixed-Info key file (Found these myself)
    - TagMo 2.3.2 or 2.3.4 beta [2.3.3 WILL NOT WORK] (Github HiddenRambler/TagMo)
    - An android phone with NFC capabilities (I used a friend's Galaxy S6)
    - An Amiibo Dump (Dumped some of my existing amiibos)
    - HxD or some hex editor (??? Google it ???)
    - A n3ds/o3ds with Adapter/Switch (Do you really need me to tell you where to get one? Just look at your local Target or something.)


Instructions to reproduce:

    - Order some NTAG215s from somewhere online. Whether you decorate them or not is entirely up to you. I just labelled mine.
    - Install TagMo onto your Android device
    - Create Locked-Secret.bin and Unfixed-Info.bin (I used HxD to make mine on my computer, and tranferred them over)
    - Load these files into TagMo
    - Dump Amiibo (Figurine) using TagMo
    - Load (Auto) dump onto NTAG215 using TagMo
    - Test/Register using Nintendo console of choice
