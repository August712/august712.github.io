<h3> Why I Left The Faith, and Why It Wasn’t For Me </h3>
<h4> Written by: Andrew Augustine </h4>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	I
figured since I</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">’ve
made this decision, and I’m probably gonna be asked several times
why, and probably have to have a bunch of conversations about it, so
I figured</SPAN></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"> I </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">should
just wrap it all up into a paper. In short, I just personally don't
believe that the faith is for me. It's too questionable, with flaws in 
logic, and shoddy attempts at coming up with excuses to cover them up. And they
just have to have an answer, even if it's a cheap one, for
everything. As a man of logic, it just didn't work for me.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	And
you can't forget that the faith over complicates everything, and this
is personified best in none other than catholic religious education.
There are some definitions that are totally contradictory to their
english language counterparts, or have nothing to do with the
original words. Like, Salvation History isn't defined as actual
history, rather as the exact opposite, a story, that was made to
explain our creation and saving from sin.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	Now
don't get me wrong, this paper isn't meant to convince you guys to 
leave the faith. Likewise, it's not just gonna be a royal diss
track for why the faith sucks, because honestly it doesn't. The
catholic faith, over the two-thousand years of its existence, has
done some wonderful things for humanity. The creation of institutions
to teach others morals, getting people to meet each other, creating
friendships that last a lifetime; It's done some really good things.
Just... being a member of a catholic school where they shove bullshit
answers down your throat for literally everything, and then relate 
everything back to the faith, it didn't work for me.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	Praying
isn't gonna make the terminally ill better. It's not gonna
cure cancer. It's not gonna end the unruly reign of dictators and
immoral people. What will do all that, however, is action. Doing
something to actually combat these forces of evil, will make change
however. Actively giving time or money to support those in need will
make change. Creating tools to help other unfortunate people will make change.
Standing up to the powers that opress will make change.
Some otherworldly figure isn't gonna come down and make
everything better. We are the change. Praying instead of doing is
just another excuse.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	Here's
my most convincing argument to date, and the ultimate reason I left.
As a man of logic, I look at the outside world seeking information
that justifies why things are the way that they are. Why they do what
they do. This study, which I ultimately found all my decision making
upon, is called science. Every time a statement comes out in politics, I
ask for the science and the facts behind it. In everything that I do,
I look for the science to back it up.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P DIR="LTR" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #ffffff; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 200%; page-break-inside: auto; text-decoration: none; page-break-after: auto">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	It
is this drive, this curiosity, that brought me to one topic that
changed my entire view of religion: Thanatophobia. The fear of death itself. 
Every human who has ever lived had this. My belief is that the &quot;almighty 
loving god&quot; we all know and love, is a mental method created to cope with 
this phobia. God is simply human imagination that went viral, so to speak. Early 
humans were scared of what came after life once they saw their friends and family 
die around them, so they created the idea of the afterlife. And a god to rule it
all. They also didn't understand the science behind reproduction, and likewise
death, so they just assumed that it was a greater being doing it all.
Every early civilization did it. From Eurasia, to South America, to
Africa; All cultures thought of this. Our Christian god is no
different from any of the others. </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	But
that brings up another point that I find most interesting. If we
created gods as we grew in civilization, who's to say that other
creatures couldn't have as well? The human's natural first-line
response to death, or anything that threatens to bring us closer to
that nonexistence, is called &quot;Fight or Flight.&quot; Whenever we
feel threatened, we either respond by fighting the forces that
threaten us, or by running away. However, it's proven that we aren't
the only creatures with this response. For example, if you try
hitting a dog with a bat, they're either gonna do one of two things:
fight the bat that threatens it, or try to get the hell outta dodge.
If they're scared of things hurting them and killing them, then by
definition, they have thanataphobia as well. And if the creation of
gods came about from our civilizations advancing and fearing thanataphobia, 
then who's to say that other smart creatures, like dolphins, who are known 
to communicate, haven't come up with their own god as well? If
that is true, then that raises another question: What makes us
different from other creatures? And that answer's simple: </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	Nothing.
We're just the dominant race because of three simple reasons: First,
we were the fastest to evolve, and in that, we were uncontested.
We're the only creatures that have evolved fast enough to create
civilizations and networks as advanced as ours. If we look forward in
a billion years, </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">I'll</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">
bet any amount of money that humans won't be the only dominant species
on planet earth. At that point there will be other species that caught
up to us in the evolutionary race, that are just as advanced as we
are today, and we'll have to share the planet with them.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P DIR="LTR" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #ffffff; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 200%; page-break-inside: auto; text-decoration: none; page-break-after: auto">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	Second:
We have written language. The creation of paper and pen, written
knowledge has allowed us to share ideas and thoughts better than any
other species on this planet. It's allowed us to share great works,
with amazing ideas, and communicate ideas better than any
civilization without it.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	Third:
Our curiosity. Our constant drive to figure out why things are the
way they are drove us further in our quest for knowledge than the
others. Why do we exist? Why do things fall to the ground? Why this?
Why that? This curiosity motivates us, even to this day. And
ultimately, it is this curiosity that brought me to this realization.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P DIR="LTR" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #ffffff; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 200%; page-break-inside: auto; text-decoration: none; page-break-after: auto">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	So,
do I believe god exists? The answer is, surprisingly, yes. But I do
not believe that he is this otherworldly figure that can break all
known laws of physics, thermodynamics, et cetera, because he feels
like it. I believe that god is an idea created by humans that helps
us make greater decisions, and help our civilization grow. And I
fully support this idea.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	But
now you may be asking "Hey Andrew, what about Jesus Christ, the son of god,
who came down, died for our sins, and three days later was
resurrected, huh? How about <i>that?</i>" Well, I can contest that as well. One of the things that
pestered me about the catholic faith was just sheer coincidence. Say
it's a rainy day, and someone's having a bad day. When it stops
raining and a rainbow shows up, is it &quot;a message from god that
everything's gonna be okay?&quot; No, it's literally just because the
rain stopped, and there's water particles in the air that diffuse the
light and make a &quot;rainbow&quot; appear. Sheer coincidence.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P DIR="LTR" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #ffffff; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 200%; page-break-inside: auto; text-decoration: none; page-break-after: auto">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	I
believe that the whole idea of Jesus is the same. A bunch of
coincidences that matched up to godly proportions. (Literally.) A
man, who believed he was the son of god, went around preaching and
was ultimately killed. Well... maybe he wasn't killed. It's showed
that the body can enter extreme situations in order to survive. Maybe
Jesus's body, when he &quot;breathed his last&quot; just entered
shock or a deep coma, and when he was taken down and bandaged up, was
given the proper necessities to heal. Maybe he never died at all. 
(Admittedly, this part of the paper is a little bit more sketchy than 
the rest but still.) And I can get into the whole Roman documents deal, 
but I'll spare the boring parts. TL;DR: They say that he existed, but don't 
acknowledge his works at all. Therefore we have no proof, and the bible 
can't be referenced as a valid source since it was written by a bunch of Jesus's followers.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	Now
don't get me wrong, this non-belief in Jesus and god isn't me saying
&quot;Ha screw morals, I'm gonna go do drugs, have unprecedented
amounts of sex, kill a bunch of people, and do everything morally
incorrect as </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">I</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">
can.&quot; Because as fucked up as </SPAN></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">I</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">
am, I still have morals. Not &quot;catholic morality&quot; or
whatever that stupid-ass definition is, just good old-fashioned &quot;Is
this helping or hurting people?&quot; (with some add-ons, of course.)
Does this ultimately make me happy? Not like, temporary pleasure, but
does this make me truly happy? Is this fulfilling?  Helping that man
on the side of the street, does that make me happy? Leading my friends 
on their computer careers? Supporting all my friends who are faith-filled 
to experience their true happiness? The answer is yes. Because
humans were created to help one another, and to lead one another.
This is what makes me happy. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	Now,
here's another important side-point. This paper is </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>not</I></SPAN></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">
for rebellious high-schoolers to use and say &quot;Yeah I believe in
that&quot; as an excuse to go do immoral things in college, because
ultimately, unless you can prove that you believe in something else,
and write up a however-many-pages-long-this-paper-is paper, you
honestly aren't in the morally right to make a decision like that.
And that's actually a good segue.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Helvetica Neue, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">	What
I now believe in, is good and evil. And most humans, over many
faiths, believe in this as well. Most are personified in the forms of
God and Satan, or Yin and Yang, but I just believe in the ideas of
good and evil themselves. Not personified in any way. Just general
good, and general evil. And to guide me is my good old-fashioned
morals. It's taken me through all of middle-school and high-school,
and it hasn't led me wrong yet, in leadership and not in leadership, 
in social life and not in social life, so I'm just gonna stick with it.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

guess </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif">I'll</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">
wrap up with this. Once again, I'm not dissing the Catholic (or I
guess really, Christian) faith. These are just the reasons I believe in
that caused me to leave. If you want, you can believe that everything
I just said is bullshit, and I get it. I support you all through
every decision you guys make. If you're gay, straight, trans or not,
catholic or not, I support everyone's decisions. As long as it makes
you happy, and you fully believe in it, I in turn, fully support you
and that decision. And I hope you all can come to do the same with
me.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
