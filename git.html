            <!-- How do I save my work? -->
            <h3>How do I save my work?</h3>
            <p>Remember the holy trinity of commands! Make sure you're on a feature or bug branch, and run these:</p>
            <div class="tm">$ git add *</div>
            <div class="tm">$ git commit -m "Summary of what you did"</div>
            <div class="tm">$ git push</div>
            <p>The <code>git add</code> command tells git to add a file to be staged for the next commit. <i>(Note: Similarly, if you want a file to be removed from git, you can use <code>git rm</code>)</i></p>
            <p>The <code>git commit</code> command tells git to take a shapshot of the changed you've made to your staged files, and save them as a commit.</p>
            <p>The <code>git push</code> command takes the commits you've made, and uploads them to github.</p>
            <hr>

            <!-- Initial Setup -->
            <h3>How do I initially set up my development environment?</h3>
            <p>There are a few commands that we'll need to run to get the repo into shape.</p>
            <p>First, clone the repo and cd into it:</p>
            <div class="tm">$ git clone  https://github.com/[yourUsernameHere]/CreatorConnect</div>
            <div class="tm">$ cd CreatorConnect</div>
            <p>Now, make sure you're looking at the develop branch.</p>
            <div class="tm">$ git checkout develop</div>
            <p>So, we have your fork of the repo, but we need to make sure it's in sync with the Hub's repo. To do that, we'll need to set an upstream.</p>
            <p>Run this command on your computer and check if your response looks like this:</p>
            <div class="tm">$ git remote -v<br>
            origin  https://github.com/Azure-Agst/CreatorConnect (fetch)<br>
            origin  https://github.com/Azure-Agst/CreatorConnect (push)<br>
            upstream        https://github.com/FSUInnovationHub/CreatorConnect.git (fetch)<br>
            upstream        https://github.com/FSUInnovationHub/CreatorConnect.git (push)
            </div>
            <p>If you're missing the two upstream entries, run this command:</p>
            <div class="tm">$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/FSUInnovationHub/CreatorConnect.git</div>
            <p>Now, whwnever you want to sync with the Hub's version of develop, run this:</p>
            <div class="tm">$ git pull upstream develop</div>
            <hr>

            <!-- Making a branch -->
            <h3>How do I go about making a new branch?</h3>
            <p>We do not allow people to push to the FSUInnovationHub's master or develop branches directly. 
                We only allow pull requests from feature branches or bug branches to be merged into develop, 
                and live software to be pushed to master.</p>
            <p>So how do you name a new branch? Which should you use?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you're working on a <b>feature</b>, use a feature branch! <br> Feature branches are prefixed with 
                    <code>f/</code> and are usually one word the describes what you're working on. (I.e. <code>f/newFeature</code>)</li>
                <li>If you're working on a <b>bug fix</b>, use a bug branch! <br> Bug branches are prefixed with
                    <code>b/</code> and are numerically assigned in ascending order. (I.e. The 123rd bug fix would be on branch
                    <code>b/123</code>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To make a new branch, make sure you're already in the develop branch of your fork, and use this:</p>
            <div class="tm">$ git checkout -b [newBranchName]</div>
            <p>This creates a new branch on your local machine. Make sure your upstream is still set by doing <code>git remote.</code></p>
            <div class="tm">$ git remote -v</div>
            <p>Once you're on your new branch, make your changes! Use <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> to save your changes to a commit.</p>
            <p>Once you're ready to push, follow the instructions in the following question.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>My current branch has no upstream? What does that mean?</h3>
            <p>Now, you can't just <code>git push</code> on a new branch because <code>git checkout -b</code> doesn't automatically make a corresponding branch on GitHub for us! To tell GitHub to make a new branch for us, we use this command:</p>
            <div class="tm">$ git push origin [newBranchName]</div>
            <p>Github should now make that corresponding branch for us and upload the code from our machine into it. Now, use the website to make a pull request, and merge into develop!</p>

            <!-- How do I see what files are staged for my next commit? -->
            <h3>How do I check what files are staged for my next commit?</h3>
            <p>You can see what files are staged for addition, deletion, modification, or are ignored in your next commit by running this command:</p>
            <div class="tm">$ git status</div>
            <hr>
            
            <!-- Develop updated! -->
            <h3>Develop has updated cince I made my feature branch! What do I do?</h3>
            <p>Don't worry! When you merge your feature branch's commits into develop, it should automatically take care of any conflicts for you.</p>
